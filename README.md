#HGTL
This is the implementation for our paper: "Heterogeneous Graph Transfer Learning for Category-aware Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation".

We implement our HGTL with an adaption code from the published code of SASRec. We mainly run our code in 'python 3.7+ PyTorch 1.7'.

We will release the full version of this project in the future.

##Usage
To train HGTL, try the script given in project.

$ bash train.sh
