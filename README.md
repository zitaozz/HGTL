# HGTL

This is the implementation for our paper: "Heterogeneous Graph Transfer Learning for Category-aware Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation".

We implement our HGTL with an adaption code from the published code of [SASRec](https://github.com/pmixer/SASRec.pytorch). We mainly run our code in 'python 3.7+ PyTorch 1.7'.


## Usage
To train HGTL, (1) download the pretrained model "Bert-Base-Uncased" from https://huggingface.co/, and (2) try the script given in project.
```
$ bash train.sh
```
